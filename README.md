Data collected **November 2025** via Prolific.  
Final sample size: **n = 505**.

**Themes:**  
Digital trust, AI-generated content, misinformation, detection accuracy, verification confidence, uncertainty, values alignment, emotional responses.

**Outputs:**  
Likert-style numeric scores (1–7), multi-select variables, open-text responses, demographics.
